## Finding a research question

### Step 1: 
I have chosen the “The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health” data set. 

### Step 2: 
I am an urban planner and I am interested in how neighbourhood satisfaction is fostered when teens and children are given the freedom to explore those neighbourhoods.  

My codebook will focus on Sections 16 (”Relations with parents”), Section 18 (”Personality and family”),  and Section 36 (”Neighbourhoods). 

###Step 3: Research Question

* Is neighbourhood satisfaction of teens associated with those teens’ parental relationships? 

### Step 4: Second topic

* Is neighbourhood satisfaction also associated with the level of control that parents exert over their teenager? 

### Step 5: 

* Section 16 (”Relations with parents”) is most relevant for the second topic. 

### Step 6: Literature Review

Very few references for this topic. I did find the following: 

* TIMPERIO, ANNA, et al. (2004): Perceptions about the local neighborhood and walking and cycling among children. Preventive Medicine, 38, 39-47

* VAN VLIET, W. (1981): Neighborhood evaluations by city and suburban children. Journal of the American Planning Association, 47, 458-466

### Step 7: Hypothesis 

- Children who are happy in their neighbourhoods, tend to have parents who give them freedom to explore their neighbourhoods.
