####  Analysis of results
First, I removed teenagers age 17 and older from the sample since 17 year olds don't tend to need permission from their parents to travel independentally in their neighborhoods. The most respondents were 15 and 16 years old. 

Then I recoded the values for **year of birth** to the corresponding **age** of all interviewees. The age of all interviewees 16 and younger were calculated based on the fact that the survey was carried out in 1995. Therefore, children born in 1979 were recoded to 12 years old, 1980 to 13 years old, and so on. 

I also set all missing data to NaN.
