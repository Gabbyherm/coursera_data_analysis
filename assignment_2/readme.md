####  Analysis of results
A random sample of 6,504 adolescents were asked to indicate whether a series of statements were true for them. 
One of the statements was "You know most of the people in your neighborhood". 
Answer options were 'true', 'false', 'refused', 'don't know', and 'not applicable'. 
Of the total number,  73% of participants indicated that the statement was true. 
The majority of the students that did not agree with the statement chose 'false' (26%).

For the next question, the same adolescents were asked to indicate if it was true or false that in the past month they have stopped on the street to talk with someone who lives in their neighborhood.
Answer options were 'true', 'false', 'refused', 'don't know', and 'not applicable'. 
Of the total number,  79% of participants indicated that the statement was true. 
The majority of the students that did not agree with the statement chose 'false' (21%).

For the next question, the same adolescents were asked whether they were happy living in their neighborhood. 
Answer options were "not at all,"(3%) "very little," (6%) "somewhat," (21%) "quite a bit,"(36%) "very much,"(34%) and "don't know" (1%). 


It appears that the majority of adolescents are happy living in their neighborhoods.
